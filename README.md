## Description

The Horiseon website refactor project focuses on enhancing the code quality and structure of the Horiseon website. The original code lacked proper semantic structure, had redundant CSS styles, and contained some accessibility issues. The refactored code addresses these concerns and provides a more efficient and user-friendly website.

The project incorporates semantic HTML elements, improves accessibility by adhering to web standards, consolidates CSS styles, and optimizes the codebase for better performance. These enhancements make the website more readable, maintainable, and accessible to users with disabilities. The refactored code also ensures that the website retains its original features and appearance.

## Features and Improvements

The following are the key features and improvements made in the refactored code:

### Semantic HTML

The original code used generic HTML tags without appropriate semantic structure. The refactored code introduces semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. This improves the readability and accessibility of the website, making it easier for search engines to understand the content and users to navigate the site.

### Improved Accessibility

Accessibility has been enhanced by incorporating proper HTML semantics, providing alt attributes for images, and ensuring logical tab order and focus management. These improvements make the website more accessible to users with disabilities and conform to web accessibility standards.

### Consolidated CSS

The original code had redundant and scattered CSS styles. In the refactored code, the CSS has been consolidated and organized to eliminate duplicate styles, improve consistency, and reduce code duplication. This leads to a smaller CSS file size and easier maintenance.
